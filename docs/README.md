# Flexit GO Homey App Docs

This folder contains reference material for the Flexit GO Homey app.

`bacnet_point_catalog.json` is a simplified, user-focused point catalog (no source/provenance metadata) maintained manually.

## What You Can Do

- Add a compatible Flexit Nordic unit from the local network.
- View supply/outdoor/exhaust/extract temperatures, humidity, fan data, heater power, and filter life.
- Change fan mode and supply air target temperature.
- Reset filter timer from the maintenance action after replacing both filters.
- Set filter change interval in Advanced Settings (3 to 12 months).

## Notes

- Discovery and control work on the local network.
- The app syncs filter-related values with the unit and shows unit-reported values.

More detailed setup and troubleshooting docs can be added in a follow-up PR.
