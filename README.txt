This app integrates Flexit Nordic ventilation units with Homey Pro. It discovers supported units on the local network and adds each unit as a single Homey device. You can set supply air target temperature, change ventilation mode, and view temperatures, humidity, fan data, heater power, and filter status.

Homey Pro and the Flexit unit must be on the same local network for discovery and control. The app communicates locally and does not require a cloud service.
